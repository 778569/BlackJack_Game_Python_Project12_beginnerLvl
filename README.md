Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos. The objective is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. Players are dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" for more cards or "stand" to compete against the dealer. Face cards are worth 10, aces can be 1 or 11, and the game combines skill and luck.<br>
